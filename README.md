## 📚 About Me

I’m an Electrical and Computer Engineer with a growing interest in applying AI techniques to real-world problems — especially in healthcare and life sciences. My academic journey has equipped me with hands-on experience in deep learning, machine learning, and computational intelligence, and I’m currently exploring gene expression data for disease prediction as part of my master's thesis. I'm passionate about learning, building, and contributing to AI-driven solutions that make a meaningful impact.
